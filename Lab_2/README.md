# Lab 2

The goal of this lab is to visualise the comparison of two car fleets. Upon completing the visualisation bootstraping is used to determen the upper and lower confidance bounds.

##Standard diviation and bootstraping results

The value of the standard diviation for the current fleet is 6.4018 , while the value for the new fleet is 6.0689. After applying bootstraping the confidance interval is between the values of 19.3231 and 21.0868. For the new fleet the confidance interval is between 29.0408 and 31.8639. As the confidance intervals are not contained one within the other we can not say which fleet is better.
